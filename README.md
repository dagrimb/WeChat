WeChat is a native, mobile chat application to be used on both Android and iOS devices. It was developed in React Native, employing several of its libraries, such as asyncStorage to store messages for offline access. Other technologies used are Expo, Android Emulator, and Google Firestore Database. Users are able to instantly chat with the ones they love, taking and sending pictures, as well as their current location.
