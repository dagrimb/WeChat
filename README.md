WeChat is a native, mobile chat application to be used on both Android and iOS devices. It was developed in React Native, employing several of its libraries, such as asyncStorage to store messages for offline access. Other technologies used are Expo, Android Emulator, and Google Firestore Database. Users are able to instantly chat with the ones they love, taking and sending pictures, as well as their current location.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
-React Native
-Expo (for developing/testing React Native apps)
-Android Emulator (to see how your app looks on various Android devices)
-Google Firestore Database (cloud-based database that allows users to store and retrieve real-time data)

SETTING UP THE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT: What you will need
-A computer and mobile device
-WiFi that both your computer and mobile device can access at the same time
-A terminal
-The latest LTS Node version. If on Windows 10, upgrade using nvm-windows; otherwise, use Node Version Management (NVM).
